My PhD project on *Computed Tomography (CT) scanning for Cultural Heritage Research* is part of the [Impact4Art](https://www.nicas-research.nl/projects/impact4art/) project at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ([CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/)) and Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In 2022 I am based in London, at the British Museum, for a research placement. Over the last years, I have had the opportunity to work with colleagues at CWI and Rijksmuseum. I enjoy these collaborations and the interdisciplinary character of my research. My work is a combination of technical investigations into tailoring X-ray imaging techniques to the specific requirements of scanning cultural heritage and scanning and investigating case studies with collaborators at the museum. Next to mathematics and computer science I am interested in Science Communication, which I studied during my Masters' Specialisation at Leiden University.
