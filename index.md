From July-September 2024 I was a Museum Guest Scholar at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles (USA). In 2023/24 I am [Migelien Gerritzen Fellow at the Rijksmuseum](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research/our-research/fellows/3d-imaging). I am also affiliated with the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ([CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/)) and [Fellow at the eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellows/francien-bossema/). I obtained my PhD from Leiden University, The Netherlands in May 2024. My PhD project on *Computed Tomography (CT) scanning for Cultural Heritage Research* was part of the [Impact4Art](https://www.nicas-research.nl/projects/impact4art/) project at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica ([CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/)) and Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In 2022, I was a guest researcher at the British Museum. Over the last years, I have had the opportunity to work with colleagues at CWI and Rijksmuseum. I enjoy these collaborations and the interdisciplinary character of my research. My work is a combination of technical investigations into tailoring X-ray imaging techniques to the specific requirements of scanning cultural heritage and scanning and investigating case studies with collaborators at the museum. Next to mathematics and computer science I am interested in Science Communication, which I studied during my Masters' Specialisation at Leiden University.
